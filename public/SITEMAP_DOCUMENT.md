## 1. HOMEPAGE

**URL:** `/`
**Title:** BioRitual — Structured Biological Optimization
**Meta Description:** Simple, structured wellness protocols combining peptides, supplements, nutrition, and habits—built for your biology, goals, and lifestyle.

### Hero Section
- **Headline:** This shouldn't be this confusing. It's exhausting because too many people are confidently full of B.S.
- **Body:**
  - Peptides. Hormones. Supplements. GLP-1s. Every week there's a new hero, a new villain, and a new podcast guest who "finally explains everything."
  - You've seen this before.
  - You're old enough to remember when wellness meant a magazine in a waiting room. Then it became blogs. Then influencers. Then "biohackers." Then TikTok doctors. Then the algorithm.
  - Now every decision feels louder than it needs to be.
  - BioRitual exists for people who are tired of that.
  - Not tired of health. Tired of noise.
- **CTA:** Start with clarity → /collection/protocols

### Shop By Goal Carousel
- Links to protocol product pages (Weight Loss, Energy, Performance, Hair+Skin, Cognition, Longevity)

### Founder Quote / Qualifier Section
- **Intro:** Let's be specific. This is for you if:
  - You've had at least one quiet "oh… shit" moment about aging.
  - Your body doesn't respond the way it did at 28.
  - You're skeptical of pharma hype and influencer hype.
  - You listen to podcasts with interest — and with raised eyebrows.
  - You've tried "just be consistent" and discovered that biology does not care about motivational quotes.
- **Manifesto:**
  - You are not anti-science.
  - You are anti-nonsense.
  - You don't want a miracle.
  - You want to stop making avoidable mistakes.

### Featured Collection Section
- **Headline:** What we actually do
- **Body:** We help you think clearly about your health. Not by giving you a reset button. Not by promising to "optimize" you into a superhero. But by helping you understand what matters, what doesn't, and what comes next. We organize decisions around: Lifestyle and recovery, Training and muscle retention, Supplements, Peptides and metabolic signaling — including GLP-1s. Because certainty sells. Clarity lasts.

### Start Here Section

### Article Carousel
- Displays latest blog articles

### Three Pillars Section
- **Title:** A grown-up word about peptides and GLP-1s
- **Body:** Yes, we work with peptides. Yes, we discuss GLP-1 medications. No, they are not magic. And no, they are not moral failures. They are biological signals. Used conservatively, sequenced properly, and supported with the right habits, they can help regulate appetite, improve metabolic flexibility, support recovery, and make long-term change possible.
- The problem is not the tool. The problem is pretending tools exist outside of context.

### Value Props
1. **Tired of Noise** — You don't need another podcast hero. You need a framework that respects your intelligence and your time.
2. **Anti-Nonsense** — You're not anti-science. You're anti-B.S. We organize decisions, not hype cycles.
3. **Context Over Magic** — Peptides and GLP-1s aren't miracles or moral failures. They're tools — and tools need context.
4. **Clarity Over Certainty** — Because certainty sells. Clarity lasts. We help you think clearly, not follow blindly.

### Final CTA
- **Headline:** You don't need to reinvent yourself.
- **Description:** You just need to stop letting the loudest voice decide for you.
- **Button:** Start with clarity

## 2. ABOUT

**URL:** `/about`
**Title:** BioRitual | About Us
**Meta Description:** The story behind BioRitual — from depression and ADHD to structured biological signaling, peptides, and ownership of your health.

### Content
Four years ago, Hans went through a brutal depression and was eventually diagnosed with ADHD. By the time things were "under control," he weighed close to 300 pounds, his hormones were a mess, and the official treatment plan for ADHD felt… underwhelming. It was mostly "take these pills and good luck."

We weren't sick. But we definitely weren't well.

It took a toll on our relationship. On our energy. On how we showed up in the world. And if you've ever been in that weird in-between space — not hospitalized, not thriving — you know how frustrating that is. You can function. You just don't feel like yourself.

Hans being Hans, he decided that wasn't good enough. He went down the rabbit hole. Research papers. Mechanisms. Metabolism. Neurobiology. GLP-1s. Peptides. Not because he wanted to become a biohacker influencer, but because he wanted to feel like his body belonged to him again.

The peptides helped — yes. The weight came down. The labs improved. The pictures changed.

But that wasn't the real shift.

The real shift was realizing that most of what we call "discipline" is actually signaling. Our bodies respond to the inputs we give them. Hormones are signals. Sleep is a signal. Food is a signal. Even routines are signals.

Bad habits aren't moral failures.
Good habits aren't moral triumphs.
They're responses.

ADHD just turns the volume up on that reality. You feel the chaos of bad signals more intensely. But the principle applies to everyone: if the signals are inconsistent, the behavior will be too.

At the same time, through our nonprofit work with The Sunday Afternoon Project (https://thesundayafternoonproject.org), we were thinking a lot about storytelling. The stories we tell about ourselves. The identities we cling to. The narratives that quietly shape what we believe we're capable of.

And we started seeing the connection.

Rituals are stories in action.
Signals are biology in motion.

When you change the signals, you change the behavior. When you change the story, you change the identity.

BioRitual was born at that intersection.

We're not here to sell miracle stacks or pretend peptides are magic. There's enough useless B.S. in this space already, and frankly, we're tired of it. Most people who are curious about peptides aren't reckless — they're undereducated. They're trying to take ownership of their health in a system that doesn't give them much guidance beyond "eat less, move more."

Hans is the obsessive researcher. The systems guy. The one who wants to know why something works and when it shouldn't be used.

Luis is the connector. The heart. The one who understands that none of this matters if it doesn't feel human.

Together, we built BioRitual for people who aren't looking for hacks — they're looking for ownership. People who don't feel terrible, but don't feel great either. People who suspect their body is capable of more alignment than they're currently experiencing.

This isn't about perfection. It's not about six-packs or moral superiority.

It's about signals.
It's about structure.
It's about reclaiming authorship of your own story.

And yes — it's about cutting through the noise with something grounded, structured, and actually useful.
